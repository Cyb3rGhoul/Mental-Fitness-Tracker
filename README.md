# Mental Fitness Tracker

## Overview
A critical first step in improving mental health therapies and diagnostics is the prediction of mental health outcomes using machine learning algorithms. This project assesses the accuracy of several machine learning models in predicting mental fitness levels using a large dataset that covers a variety of mental health conditions.

## Project Objectives
- Predict mental fitness levels using various machine learning regression techniques.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of different models.
- Identify the most accurate model for mental health outcome prediction.

## Machine Learning Models Used
We implemented and tested the following regression models:
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector
- Decision Tree
- Linear Regression

## Key Findings
- **Random Forest Regressor** performed the best with an R-squared score of **0.99**.
- R-squared values of other models ranged from **0.76 to 0.98**, indicating varied degrees of accuracy.
- **Support Vector Regressor** showed limited predictive potential with an R-squared score of **0.00**.

These findings highlight the potential for improving prediction accuracy for mental health evaluations using ensemble learning techniques, particularly Random Forest.

## Implications
The results of this study can guide the development of more accurate mental health prediction instruments, leading to better mental health treatment and intervention techniques.
